# Sway Config

Sway is a wayland version of i3wm. This is forever changing. Use at own risk!
Several features are missing, but will continue adding.

## Dependencies

Some tools are required for full features. There will eventually be a
script to auto install dependencies.

- [light](https://github.com/haikarainen/light)
- [font-awesome-desktop](https://fontawesome.com/download)
- [swaylock](https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock)
- [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

## Todo

- Add function key support (brightness, volume, etc.)
- Add dependency script
- Add keybindings to README
